# Steckdosen•Freund
The **Steckdosen•Freund** is an intelligent controller for outdoor plugs including power measurement, optical control on LEDs and a cool website perfectly to use old smartphones as displays.

It contains an outdoor box with threee plugs and an indoor box with three Shelly PM Mini Gen 3. This can be up- or downscaled - however you like.
